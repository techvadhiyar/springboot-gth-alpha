So this is a STS | Git Hub | Travis CI | JAR file deployment to Docker Hub

https://dzone.com/articles/spring-boot-heroku-and-cicd  ---------- nice article !
(He uses the Heroku Maven Plugin to deploy from Tavis CI to Heroku)

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/deploying-java-applications-with-the-heroku-maven-plugin
https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile


So Travis CI compiles but gives this message - 
The requested profile "heroku" could not be activated because it does not exist.

Let's see...found this article...

Looks like I forgot to create a Procfile for Heroku...lets do that.
Instructions - https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/procfile

https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/java-support#default-web-process-type

Changed approach...following this article
https://medium.com/@felippepuhle/getting-started-with-spring-boot-travis-and-heroku-4562a723fd0e

Now the app is successfully deployed but not running...no dynos running....checking...

OK...works now....had to do several things as so:
- first, had to delete the heroku app and recreate again since the dyno assignment in the resource tab was incorrect from previous installs.
- cleaned up the .travis.yml to remove the zip_file....instead deploy the entire stack
- you have to create the Heroku app prior to the Travis deployment in its current setup
- fixed the Procfile syntax from recommendations in the above links
- re-ran the build and deployed to the newly created app - the resources tab registred the dyno settings.
- Ran the cli command - hereoku ps --app <app name> and could see the dyno assigned.
- Opened the app - got the page not found and was then able to run this URI: https://springboot-gth-alpha.herokuapp.com/api/greetings/greeting?name=hs
	- and it worked !!! Phew !!!!
	
Freeze this setup for now.
